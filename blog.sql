Bundlers allow us to package, compile, and organize the many assets and libraries needed for a modern web project.</p>\r\n<p>In this tutorial we will take a look at <a href=\"https://webpack.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">webpack</a>, a powerful open-source bundler and preprocessor that can handle a huge variety of different tasks. We\'ll show you how to write modules, bundle code, and use some of the loader plugins. The tutorial is designed for total beginners to webpack, but having some JavaScript knowledge is advised.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2017/04/webpack-logo.jpg\" alt=\"webpack-logo.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Why webpack?</h2>\r\n<p>Much like any other aspect of web development, there isn\'t a standard for which build tool to use. Right now, developers have to choose between <a href=\"https://webpack.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">webpack</a>, <a href=\"http://gulpjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gulp</a>, <a href=\"http://browserify.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browserify</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NPM scripts</a>, <a href=\"https://gruntjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Grunt</a>, and like 10 others. There are many in-depth comparisons out there, but all of these tools are very similar, so most of the time it comes down to personal preference and what project you are working on.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some pros and cons to help you decide whether webpack is the tool for you:</p>\r\n<p>Pros:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Great for working with singe-page apps</li>\r\n<li>Accepts both <code>require()</code> and <code>import</code> module syntaxes</li>\r\n<li>Allows for very advanced <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#components/sidebar/sidebar.jsx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">code splitting</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hot Reload</a> for quicker development with React, Vue.js and similar frameworks</li>\r\n<li>?ost popular build tool according to the <a href=\"http://stateofjs.com/2016/buildtools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2016 JavaScript survey</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Cons:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Not suitable for beginners in web development</li>\r\n<li>Working with CSS files, images, and other non-JS resources is confusing at first</li>\r\n<li>Documentation could be better</li>\r\n<li>Changes a lot, even most 2016 tutorials are already outdated</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Installation</h2>\r\n<p>The easiest way to install webpack is by using a package manager. We will go with <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">npm</a> but feel free to use <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yarn</a> or another hip alternative. In both cases you need to have <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Node.js</a> on your machine and a <em>package.json</em> ready to go.</p>\r\n<p>It is preferred to install it locally (without the <code>-g</code> tag). This will make sure everyone working on your project has the same version of webpack.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\" data-type=\"plain\">npm <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">install</span> webpack <span class=\"hljs-comment\">--save-dev</span></pre>\r\n<p>Once we have it installed, it\'s best to run webpack via a Node.js script. Add these lines to your package.json:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\">\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"scripts\"</span>: {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"build\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"webpack -p\"</span>,\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"watch\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"webpack --watch\"</span>\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>Now by calling <code>npm run build</code> from the terminal we can make webpack bundle our files (the <code>-p</code> option stands for production and minifies the bundled code). Running <code>npm run watch</code> will start a process that automatically bundles our files when any of them change.</p>\r\n<p>The last part of the setup is to tell webpack which files to bundle up. The recommended way to do this is by creating a config file.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h2>Webpack Config File</h2>\r\n<p>Here we will look at the config file in its most basic form but don\'t let that fool you - the webpack config file is quite powerful, varies a lot from project to project, and can become super complex in some cases.</p>\r\n<p>In the root directory of your project add a file called <em>webpack.config.js</em>.</p>\r\n<h3>webpack.config.js</h3>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> path = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'path\'</span>);\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">module</span>.exports = {\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">entry</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'./assets/js/index.js\'</span>,\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">output</span>: {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">filename</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'bundle.js\'</span>,\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">path</span>: path.resolve(__dirname, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'dist\'</span>)\r\n  }\r\n};</pre>\r\n<p>The <strong>entry</strong> option tells webpack which is our main JavaScript file. There are many different <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">strategies</a> for configuring entry points but in most cases a single entry is enough.</p>\r\n<p>In <strong>output</strong> we specify the name and path of our bundle. After running webpack we will have all our JavaScript in a file called <strong>bundle.js</strong>. This is the only script file that we will link in our HTML:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"html hljs xml\" data-type=\"html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">src</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"./dist/bundle.js\"</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span>></span></pre>\r\n<p>This setup should be enough to get us started. Later we will add some more stuff to it, but first let\'s see how modules work.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h2>Webpack Modules</h2>\r\n<p>Webpack provides <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/concepts/modules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">multiple ways</a> to work with modules, and most of the time you are free to go with whichever one you like. For this tutorial we will use the ES6 <code>import</code> syntax.</p>\r\n<p>We want to add a module that greets our users. We create a file called <em>greeter.js</em> and make it export a simple function:</p>\r\n<h3>greeter.js</h3>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">greet</span>() </span>{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'Have a great day!\'</span>);\r\n};\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">default</span> greet;</pre>\r\n<p>To use this module, we have to import it and call it in our <strong>entry point</strong>, which if you look back at the config file is index.js.</p>\r\n<h3>index.js</h3>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> greet <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'./greeter.js\'</span>;\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"I\'m the entry point\"</span>);\r\ngreet();</pre>\r\n<p>Now when we run the bundler with <code>npm run build</code>, and open our HTML in the browser, we see this:</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2017/04/console-greet.png\" alt=\"console-greet.png\" /></p>\r\n<p>Our entry point and our greeter module were compiled into one file called <em>bundle.js</em> and it was executed by the browser.</p>','2019-07-07 08:59:55','In this tutorial, we will take a look at webpack, a powerful open-source bundler and preprocessor that can handle a huge variety of different tasks.',1,0,'2019-07-07 09:00:14','Learn Webpack in 15 Minutes ','2019-07-07 08:59:55',6,3,1,0),(3,'<h1 class=\"article__title\">10 Interesting JavaScript and CSS Libraries for April 2019</h1>\r\n<p>Our mission at Tutorialzine is to keep you up to date with the latest and coolest trends in web development.

It requires an API key, so if you already have one you can use it, otherwise you can go to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this link</a> to learn how to create one. When you have your key ready, simply replace the \"YOUR_API_KEY\" part of the script.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"html hljs xml\" data-type=\"html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">src</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY\"</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span>></span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">src</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gmaps.js/0.4.25/gmaps.js\"</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span>></span>\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>Now we need to generate the map. We create a new map object and as parameters we set the selector (\'#map\'), and the latitude and longitude of the point we want to show on the map.</p>\r\n<p>Next we need to add a marker on the map. To do so, use the <code>addMarker()</code> method with the latitude and longitude where you want to place it. We can also set the initial zoom at which the map is displayed using the <code>setZoom()</code> method with an integer number as parameter. The lower the number, the more \"zoomed in\" the map is.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"javascript hljs\" data-type=\"javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> map = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> GMaps({\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">el</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'#map\'</span>,\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">lat</span>:  <span class=\"hljs-number\">40.730610</span>,\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">lng</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">-73.935242</span>\r\n});\r\n\r\nmap.addMarker({\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">lat</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">40.700610</span>,\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">lng</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">-73.997242</span>,\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">title</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'New York\'</span>\r\n});\r\n\r\nmap.setZoom(<span class=\"hljs-number\">8</span>);\r\n</pre>\r\n<h2>Styles</h2>\r\n<p>The styles are located in a separate CSS file.

Flexbox made it easy to properly align elements and their content, and is now the preferred CSS system of most web developers.</p>\r\n<p>Now we have a new contender for the best-system-to-build-html-layouts trophy (trophy title is a work in progress). It is the mighty <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CSS Grid</a>, and by the end of this month, it will be available natively in <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/03/firefox-52-introducing-web-assembly-css-grid-and-the-grid-inspector/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Firefox 52</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/03/nic57\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chrome 57</a>, with other browsers (hopefully) following soon.</p>\r\n<h2>A Basic Layout Test</h2>\r\n<p>To get a sense of what it\'s like to build layouts with each system, we\'ve build the same HTML page twice - once with flexbox, and another time with the CSS grid. You can download both projects from the <strong>Download</strong> button near the top of the article, or inspect them in this online demo:</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2017/03/html-layout.png\" alt=\"html-layout.png\" /></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The design is pretty basic - it consists of a centered container, inside of which we have a header, main section, sidebar, and a footer. Here are the main \"challenges\" that we\'ll have to solve, while keeping CSS and HTML as clean as possible:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Position the four major sections of the layout.</li>\r\n<li>Make the page responsive (the sidebar goes below the main content on smaller screens).</li>\r\n<li>Align the contents of the header - navigation to the left, button to the right.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>As you can see, for the sake of the comparison we\'ve kept everything very simple. Let\'s start with problem number one.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenge 1: Position The Page Sections</h2>\r\n<h3>Flexbox Solution</h3>\r\n<p>We\'ll start off with the flexbox solution. We add <code>display: flex</code> to the container and direction its children vertically. This will position all the sections one under another.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"css hljs\" data-type=\"css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.container</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">display</span>: flex;\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">flex-direction</span>: column;\r\n}</pre>\r\n<p>Now we need to make the main section and the sidebar stand next to each other. Since flex containers are generally one-directional, we will need to add a wrapper element.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"html hljs xml\" data-type=\"html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">header</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">header</span>></span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"main-and-sidebar-wrapper\"</span>></span>\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">section</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"main\"</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">section</span>></span>\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">aside</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"sidebar\"</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">aside</span>></span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>></span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">footer</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">footer</span>></span></pre>\r\n<p>We then make the wrapper <code>display:flex</code> and <code>flex-direction</code> it in the opposite direction.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"css hljs\" data-type=\"css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.main-and-sidebar-wrapper</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">display</span>: flex;\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">flex-direction</span>: row;\r\n}</pre>\r\n<p>The last step is to set the size of the main section and the sidebar. We want the main content to be three times the size of the sidebar, which isn\'t hard to do with <code>flex</code> or percentages.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"css hljs\" data-type=\"css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.main</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">flex</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">3</span>;\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">margin-right</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">60px</span>;\r\n}\r\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.sidebar</span> {\r\n   <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">flex</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>;\r\n}</pre>\r\n<p>As you can see flexbox did pretty well, but we still needed quite a lot of CSS properties + an additional HTML element. Let\'s see how the CSS grid will do.</p>\r\n<h3>CSS Grid Solution</h3>\r\n<p>There are a couple of different ways to use the CSS grid, but we will go with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">grid-template-areas</a> syntax, as it seems most suitable for what we are trying to accomplish.</p>\r\n<p>First we will define four <code>grid-area</code>-s, one for each page section:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"html hljs xml\" data-type=\"html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">header</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">header</span>></span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\"><!-- Notice there isn\'t a wrapper this time --></span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">section</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"main\"</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">section</span>></span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">aside</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"sidebar\"</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">aside</span>></span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">footer</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">footer</span>></span></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"css hljs\" data-type=\"css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">header</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-area</span>: header;\r\n}\r\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.main</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-area</span>: main;\r\n}\r\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.sidebar</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-area</span>: sidebar;\r\n}\r\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">footer</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-area</span>: footer;\r\n}</pre>\r\n<p>Then we can set up our grid and assign the placement of each area. The code below may seem quite complicated at first, but once you get to know the grid system it becomes really easy to grasp.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"css hljs\" data-type=\"css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.container</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">display</span>: grid;\r\n\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">/*  Define the size and number of columns in our grid. \r\n    The fr unit works similar to flex:\r\n    fr columns will share the free space in the row in proportion to their value.\r\n    We will have 2 columns - the first will be 3x the size of the second.  */</span>\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-template-columns</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">3</span>fr <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>fr;\r\n\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">/*  Assign the grid areas we did earlier to specific places on the grid. \r\n        First row is all header.\r\n        Second row is shared between main and sidebar.\r\n        Last row is all footer.  */</span>\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-template-areas</span>: \r\n        <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"header header\"</span>\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"main sidebar\"</span>\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"footer footer\"</span>;\r\n\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">/*  The gutters between each grid cell will be 60 pixels. */</span>\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-gap</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">60px</span>;\r\n}</pre>\r\n<p>And that\'s it! Our layout will now follow the above structure, and because of the way we\'ve set it up we don\'t even have to deal with any margins or paddings.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenge 2: Make Page Responsive</h2>\r\n<h3>Flexbox Solution</h3>\r\n<p>The execution of this step is strongly connected to the previous one. For the flexbox solution we will have to change the <code>flex-direction</code> of the wrapper, and adjust some margins.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"css hljs\" data-type=\"css\">@<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">media</span> (max-width: <span class=\"hljs-number\">600px</span>) {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.main-and-sidebar-wrapper</span> {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">flex-direction</span>: column;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.main</span> {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">margin-right</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>;\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">margin-bottom</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">60px</span>;\r\n    }\r\n}</pre>\r\n<p>Our page is really simple so there isn\'t much to rework in the media query, but in a more complex layout there will be lots and lots of stuff to redefine.</p>\r\n<h3>CSS Grid Solution</h3>\r\n<p>Since we already have the <code>grid-areas</code> defined, we just need to reorder them in a media-query. We can use the same column setup.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"css hljs\" data-type=\"css\">@<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">media</span> (max-width: <span class=\"hljs-number\">600px</span>) {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.container</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">/*  Realign the grid areas for a mobile layout. */</span>\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-template-areas</span>: \r\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"header header\"</span>\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"main main\"</span>\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"sidebar sidebar\"</span>\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"footer footer\"</span>;\r\n    }\r\n}</pre>\r\n<p>Or, we can redefine the entire layout from scratch if we think that\'s a cleaner solution.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"css hljs\" data-type=\"css\">@<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">media</span> (max-width: <span class=\"hljs-number\">600px</span>) {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.container</span> {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">/*  Redefine the grid into a single column layout. */</span>\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-template-columns</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>fr;\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-template-areas</span>: \r\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"header\"</span>\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"main\"</span>\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"sidebar\"</span>\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"footer\"</span>;\r\n    }\r\n}</pre>\r\n<h2>Challenge 3: Align Header Components</h2>\r\n<h3>Flexbox Solution</h3>\r\n<p>Our header includes some links for navigation and a button.

The technique is really simple:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"css hljs\" data-type=\"css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">header</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">display</span>: flex;\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">justify-content</span>: space-between;\r\n}</pre>\r\n<p>Now the navigation list and the button are properly aligned. All that is left is to make the items inside the <code><nav></code> go horizontally. It\'s easiest to use <code>display: inline-block</code> here, but since we are going full flexbox, let\'s apply a flexbox-only solution:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"css hljs\" data-type=\"css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">header</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">nav</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">display</span>: flex;\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">align-items</span>: baseline;\r\n}</pre>\r\n<p>Only two lines! Not bad at all. Let\'s see how CSS grid handles it.</p>\r\n<h3>CSS Grid Solution</h3>\r\n<p>To split the nav and the button we will have to make the header <code>display: grid</code> and set up a 2-column grid. We will also need two extra lines of CSS to position them at the respective borders.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"css hljs\" data-type=\"css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">header</span>{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">display</span>: grid;\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-template-columns</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>fr <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>fr;\r\n}\r\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">header</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">nav</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">justify-self</span>: start;\r\n}\r\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">header</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">button</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">justify-self</span>: end;\r\n}</pre>\r\n<p>As for the inline links inside the navigation - we couldn\'t get it quite right with CSS grid. Here is how our best try looks:</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2017/03/css-grid-header.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The links are inline but they can\'t be properly aligned, since there isn\'t a <code>baseline</code> option like in flexbox\'s <code>align-items</code>. We also had to define yet another subgrid.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"css hljs\" data-type=\"css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">header</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">nav</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">display</span>: grid;\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-template-columns</span>: auto <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>fr <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>fr;\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">align-items</span>: end; \r\n}</pre>\r\n<p>It\'s clear that the CSS grid struggled with this part of the layout, but that isn\'t too surprising - it\'s focus is on aligning containers, not so much the content inside them. It just isn\'t meant for doing finishing touches.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>If you\'ve made it through the whole article (in which case great job!), the conclusion shouldn\'t come as a surprise to you. The truth is, there isn\'t a <em>better</em> system - both flexbox and the CSS grid are good at different things and should be used <strong>together</strong>, not as alternatives to one another.</p>\r\n<p>For those of you who skip directly to the conclusion of articles (no worries, we do it too), here is a summary of the comparison:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>CSS grids are great for building the bigger picture. They makes it really easy to manage the layout of the page, and can even handle more unorthodox and asymmetrical designs.</li>\r\n<li>Flexbox is great at aligning the content inside elements. Use flex to position the smaller details of a design.</li>\r\n<li>Use CSS grids for 2D layouts (rows AND columns).</li>\r\n<li>Flexbox works better in one dimension only (rows OR columns).</li>\r\n<li>There is no reason to use only CSS grids or only flexbox.

To help you grasp more of its many features, we\'ve curated a list of 30 free learning resources that cover it all - from the quickstart guide to specific details and best practices</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/09/1_official.png\" alt=\"tut1\" /></p>\r\n<p>Let\'s first quickly go over the available guides and tutorials on the official Angular website. There are a bunch of different resources there and we decided it\'s a good idea to explain them.</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">QuickStart (TypeScript version)</a></h2>\r\n<p>Angular2 apps can be written in TypeScript, Dart, or good ol\' vanilla JavaScript. There are separate versions of the official docs for each language, but the TypeScript one is by far most detailed, as this is the recommended technology to use.</p>\r\n<p>This will be the starting point for most beginners to Angular2. It includes setting up a work environment and running a basic Hello World app. Don\'t be fooled by its name, you will need a good hour or two to finish this QuickStart.</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/quickstart.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">QuickStart (Vanilla JavaScript version)</a></h2>\r\n<p>A much simpler version of the TypeScript QuickStart. Since it is written for vanilla JavaScript this tutorial doesn\'t require a complex work environment and setup, so it goes straight to the framework itself and some of it\'s main concepts.</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tour of Heroes</a></h2>\r\n<p>Tour of heroes is a much more detailed tutorial than the QuickStart. It goes through the process of building a Single Page App, step by step, covering many of the must-know Angular2 features. There are TypeScript and Dart versions, but no vanilla JS.</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/ngmodule.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Advanced Documentation</a></h2>\r\n<p>Here the Angular team offers over 15 standalone tutorials, each doing a very in-depth look into an important topic. You can learn about Angular animations, the lifecycle of components, the navigation router, and many other core features.</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cookbook</a></h2>\r\n<p>A collection of code snippets and quick solutions to common challenges.

We\'re going to construct the whole thing from scratch to demonstrate just how easy it is to create user interfaces with a framework like Vue.</p>\r\n<p>This tutorial requires you to have at least some basic knowledge of JavaScript and Vue.js. If you aren\'t familiar with Vue.js at all, we advise you to go and check out our article <a href=\"https://tutorialzine.com/2016/03/5-practical-examples-for-learning-vue-js/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">5 Practical Examples For Learning Vue.js</a>, where we show many of the core concepts with practical code snippets.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>This article has been updated and now works with Vue.js v2!</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h2>The App</h2>\r\n<p>What we want from our application is simply to fetch the feed from a number of subbreddits and display them. Here is what the end result will look like:<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/08/vue-app.png\" alt=\"vue-app\" /></p>\r\n<p>We will have six separate subreddit feeds showing five posts each. The posts have links to the content and discussion on reddit, as well as some other details. For the sake of simplicity we have omitted features such as adding/removing subreddits and doing searches, but they can be easily added on top of the existing app.</p>\r\n<h2>Setting Up The Workspace</h2>\r\n<p>You can download the full source code for the reddit browser app from the <strong>Download</strong> button near the top of the article. Before we actually look at the code, let\'s make sure that everything is setup properly. Here is an overview of the file structure:</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/08/directory.png\" alt=\"dir\" /></p>\r\n<p>As you can see it\'s quite basic: we just have one HTML file, one CSS file, a <em>script.js</em> containing our JavaScript code. We\'ve also added local copies of the <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/installation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vue.js</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-resource\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vue-resource</a> libraries, but you can use a CDN if you prefer</p>\r\n<p>Thankfully, Vue.js doesn\'t require any special configuration, so it should work straight out of the box. To start the app we just have to create a global Vue instance:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> Vue({\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">el</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'#main\'</span>\r\n});</pre>\r\n<p>The only thing left to do now is start a local web server to enable cross-origin AJAX requests to the reddit API. The easiest way to do this on OS X/Ubuntu is by running the following command from the project\'s directory:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs nginx\" data-type=\"plain\"><span class=\"hljs-attribute\">python</span> -m SimpleHTTPServer <span class=\"hljs-number\">8080</span></pre>\r\n<p>If everything is done properly our project should be available at <a href=\"http://localhost:8080/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">localhost:8080</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Creating Custom Components</h2>\r\n<p>Our app is going to need two reusable components - one for the <strong>Posts</strong>, and another for <strong>Subreddits</strong>. The two components will be in a Child-Parent relationship, meaning that the Subreddit component will have multiple Posts nested in it.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/08/components-1.png\" alt=\"comp\" /></p>\r\n<p>Let\'s start with the Subreddit component, and more specifically it\'s JavaScript:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Parent | Subreddit component containing a list of \'post\' components. </span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> subreddit = Vue.component(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'subreddit\'</span>,{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">template</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'#subreddit\'</span>,\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">props</span>: [<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'name\'</span>],\r\n\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">data</span>: <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> () </span>{\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">posts</span>: [] }\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">created</span>: <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>()</span>{\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">this</span>.$http.get(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"https://www.reddit.com/r/\"</span>+ <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">this</span>.name +<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"/top.json?limit=5\"</span>)\r\n        .then(<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">resp</span>)</span>{\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span>(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">typeof</span> resp.data == <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'string\'</span>) {\r\n               resp.data = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">JSON</span>.parse(resp.data);\r\n            }\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">this</span>.posts=resp.data.data.children;\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n});</pre>\r\n<p>Here we define the new component under the name <strong>subreddit</strong>. In <code>props</code> we provide an array with all the parameters our component can receive - in this case it is just the name of the subbreddit we want to browse. Now if we want to add a subreddit block to the HTML we will use this markup:</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<pre class=\"html hljs xml\" data-type=\"html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">subreddit</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">name</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"food\"</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">subreddit</span>></span></pre>\r\n<p>The <code>data</code> property defines what variables are needed for each instance of the component and their default values. We will start with an empty <code>posts</code> array, and populate it in the <code>created</code> method. When a <code><subreddit></code> tag is created, Vue will take its <code>name</code> property, make a call to the reddit API to fetch the top 5 posts from the subreddit with that name, and save them in <code>this.posts</code>. For the HTTP requests we\'ve used the <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-resource\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vue-resource</a> library instead of jQuery, since it is way tinier and automatically binds the correct context for <code>this</code>.</p>\r\n<p>After we\'ve acquired everything we need in the model, Vue.js will automatically render our Subreddit components. The actual view that the user sees is defined in a template in <em>index.html</em>:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"html hljs xml\" data-type=\"html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">template</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">id</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"subreddit\"</span>></span>\r\n\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"subreddit\"</span>></span>\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">h2</span>></span>{{ name | uppercase }}<span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">h2</span>></span>\r\n\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">ul</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"item-list\"</span>></span>\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">li</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">v-for</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"obj in posts\"</span>></span>\r\n                <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">post</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">:item</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"obj\"</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">post</span>></span>\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">li</span>></span>\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">ul</span>></span>\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>></span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">template</span>></span></pre>\r\n<p>Personally, I like to wrap all the elements of a component in a <code>div</code> container. This makes them easier to style and also seems more semantic (to me at least). Inside that container we have a title that goes through an uppercase filter (we will cover filters later in the article) and an unordered list iterating over the elements returned from the reddit API call.</p>\r\n<p>If you look closely at the HTML, you\'ll also notice we are using a <code><post></code> tag. This isn\'t some new fancy HTML element - it\'s our child component!</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Child | Componenet represiting a single post.</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> post = Vue.component(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'post\'</span>, {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">template</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"#post\"</span>,\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">props</span>: [<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'item\'</span>],\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">methods</span>: {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">getImageBackgroundCSS</span>: <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">img</span>) </span>{\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span>(img && img!=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'self\'</span> && img!=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'nsfw\'</span>) {\r\n                <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'background-image: url(\'</span> + img + <span class=\"hljs-string\">\')\'</span>;    \r\n            }\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">else</span> {\r\n                <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'background-image: url(assets/img/placeholder.png)\'</span>; \r\n            }\r\n        }       \r\n    }\r\n});</pre>\r\n<p>Post components will expect a object called <code>item</code> containing all of the information about a single post on reddit - things like title, URLs, number of comments, etc. As we saw earlier, this is done in a <code>v-for</code> loop inside the Subreddit (parent) component:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"html hljs xml\" data-type=\"html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">li</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">v-for</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"obj in posts\"</span>></span>\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">post</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">:item</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"obj\"</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">post</span>></span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">li</span>></span></pre>\r\n<p>The colon prefixing <code>:item=\"obj\"</code> is very important. It tells Vue that we are proving a JavaScript object called <em>obj</em> (as opposed to the string <code>\"obj\"</code>), allowing us to pass the data from the <code>v-for</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Now that we have all the needed properties for a post, we can display them.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"html hljs xml\" data-type=\"html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">template</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">id</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"post\"</span>></span>\r\n\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"post\"</span>></span>\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">a</span>   <span class=\"hljs-attr\">:href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"item.data.url\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">:style</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"getImageBackgroundCSS(item.data.thumbnail)\"</span> \r\n             <span class=\"hljs-attr\">target</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"_blank\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"thumbnail\"</span>></span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">a</span>></span>\r\n\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"details\"</span>></span>\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">a</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">:href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"item.data.url\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">:title</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"item.data.title\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">target</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"_blank\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"title\"</span>></span>\r\n                {{ item.data.title | truncate}}\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">a</span>></span>          \r\n\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"action-buttons\"</span>></span>\r\n                <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">a</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://reddit.com{{ item.data.permalink }}\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">title</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Vote\"</span>></span>\r\n                    <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">i</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"material-icons\"</span>></span>thumbs_up_down<span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">i</span>></span>\r\n                    {{item.data.score}}\r\n                <span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">a</span>></span>\r\n\r\n                <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">a</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://reddit.com{{ item.data.permalink }}\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">title</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Go to discussion\"</span>></span>\r\n                    <span class=\"hljs-tag\"><<span class=\"hljs-name\">i</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"material-icons\"</span>></span>forum<span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">i</span>></span>\r\n                    {{item.data.num_comments}}\r\n                <span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">a</span>></span>\r\n            <span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>></span>\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>></span>\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>></span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\"></<span class=\"hljs-name\">template</span>></span></pre>\r\n<p>The above template looks scary at first, but really isn\'t. We just take the properties of the post object and display them.</p>\r\n<h2>Creating Custom Filters</h2>\r\n<p>Defining filters is quite easy. The <code>Vue.filter()</code> method provides us with the incoming string data, which we can transform whatever way we want and then simply return.</p>\r\n<p>The <code>uppercase</code> filter we mentioned earlier in the subreddit template is one of the simplest filters possible. It was actually built-into previous version of Vue but was removed in v2 along with all other text filters.</p>\r\n<p>It takes one string parameter, transforms it to uppercase and returns the result.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\">Vue.filter(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'uppercase\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">value</span>) </span>{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> value.toUpperCase();\r\n});</pre>\r\n<p>Our other filter takes strings and truncates them if they are too long. This is applied to the post titles, which often are way too lengthy for the design we had in mind.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\">Vue.filter(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'truncate\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">value</span>) </span>{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> length = <span class=\"hljs-number\">60</span>;\r\n\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span>(value.length <= length) {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> value;\r\n    }\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">else</span> {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> value.substring(<span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>, length) + <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'...\'</span>;            \r\n    }\r\n});</pre>\r\n<h2>Further Reading</h2>\r\n<p>The main focus of this tutorial was to show the process of building a simple Vue.js app. To keep it short we haven\'t stopped to explain every tiny syntax peculiarity, but worry not!

It inherits many programming concepts from languages such as C# and Java that add more discipline and order to the otherwise very relaxed and free-typed JavaScript.</p>\r\n<p>This tutorial is aimed at people who are fairly proficient in JavaScript but are still beginners when it comes to TypeScript. We\'ve covered most of the basics and key features while including lots of examples with commented code to help you see the language in action. Let\'s begin!</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/07/0__benefits.png\" alt=\"typescirpt1\" /></p>\r\n<h2>The Benefits of Using TypeScript</h2>\r\n<p>JavaScript is pretty good as it is and you may wonder <em>Do I really need to learn TypeScript?</em> Technically, you do not <em>need</em> to learn TypeScript to be a good developer, most people do just fine without it. However, working with TypeScript definitely has its benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Due to the static typing, code written in TypeScript is more predictable, and is generally easier to debug.</li>\r\n<li>Makes it easier to organize the code base for very large and complicated apps thanks to modules, namespaces and strong OOP support.</li>\r\n<li>TypeScript has a compilation step to JavaScript that catches all kinds of errors before they reach runtime and break something.</li>\r\n<li>The upcoming Angular 2 framework is written in TypeScript and it\'s recommended that developers use the language in their projects as well.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The last point is actually the most important to many people and is the main reason to get them into TypeScript. Angular 2 is one of the hottest frameworks right now and although developers can use regular JavaScript with it, a majority of the tutorials and examples are written in TS. As Angular 2 expands its community, it\'s natural that more and more people will be picking up TypeScript.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/07/1_Installation.png\" alt=\"installation\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Installing TypeScript</h2>\r\n<p>You will need Node.js and Npm for this tutorial. Go <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a> if you don\'t have them installed.</p>\r\n<p>The easiest way to setup TypeScript is via <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">npm</a>. Using the command below we can install the TypeScript package globally, making the TS compiler available in all of our projects:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs coffeescript\" data-type=\"plain\"><span class=\"hljs-built_in\">npm</span> install -g typescript</pre>\r\n<p>Try opening a terminal anywhere and running <code>tsc -v</code> to see if it has been properly installed.</p>\r\n<pre><span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">tsc</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">-v</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">Version</span> 1<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.8</span><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.10 <br /></span></pre>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/07/2_text_editors.png\" alt=\"editors\" /><br /><br /></p>\r\n<h2>Text Editors With TypeScript Support</h2>\r\n<p>TypeScript is an open-source project but is developed and maintained by Microsoft and as such was originally supported only in Microsoft\'s <a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visual Studio</a> platform. Nowadays, there are a lot more text editors and IDEs that either natively or through plugins offer support for the TypeScript syntax, auto-complete suggestions, error catching, and even built-in compilers.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visual Studio Code</a> - Microsoft\'s other, lightweight open-source code editor.

This compilation process can be done in a number of different ways:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In the terminal using the previously mentioned command line tool <code>tsc</code>.</li>\r\n<li>Directly in Visual Studio or some of the other IDEs and text editors.</li>\r\n<li>Using automated task runners such as <a href=\"http://gulpjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gulp</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We found the first way to be easiest and most beginner friendly, so that\'s what we\'re going to use in our lesson</p>\r\n<p>The following command takes a TypeScript file named <em>main.ts</em> and translates it into its JavaScript version <em>main.js</em>. If <em>main.js</em> already exists it will be overwritten.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs css\" data-type=\"plain\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">tsc</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">main</span><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.ts</span></pre>\r\n<p>We can also compile multiple files at once by listing all of them or by applying wildcards:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs css\" data-type=\"plain\"># <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">Will</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">result</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">in</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">separate</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.js</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">files</span>: <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">main</span><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.js</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">worker</span><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.js</span>.\r\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">tsc</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">main</span><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.ts</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">worker</span><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.ts</span>    \r\n\r\n# <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">Compiles</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">all</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.ts</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">files</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">in</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">the</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">current</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">folder</span>. <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">Does</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">NOT</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">work</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">recursively</span>.\r\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">tsc</span> *<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.ts</span></pre>\r\n<p>We can also use the <code>--watch</code> option to automatically compile a TypeScript file when changes are made:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs nginx\" data-type=\"plain\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Initializes a watcher process that will keep main.js up to date.</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-attribute\">tsc</span> main.ts --watch</pre>\r\n<p>More advanced TypeScript users can also create a<em> tsconfig.json</em> file, consisting of various build settings. A configuration file is very handy when working on large projects with lots of .ts files since it somewhat automates the process. You can read more about <em>tsconfig.json</em> in the TypeScript docs <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/07/4_Static_typing.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Static Typing</h2>\r\n<p>A very distinctive feature of TypeScript is the support of static typing. This means that you can declare the types of variables, and the compiler will make sure that they aren\'t assigned the wrong types of values. If type declarations are omitted, they will be inferred automatically from your code.</p>\r\n<p>Here is an example. Any variable, function argument or return value can have its type defined on initialization:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> burger: string = <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'hamburger\'</span>,     <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// String </span>\r\n    calories: number = <span class=\"hljs-number\">300</span>,           <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Numeric</span>\r\n    tasty: boolean = <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span>;            <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Boolean</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Alternatively, you can omit the type declaration:</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// var burger = \'hamburger\';</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// The function expects a string and an integer.</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// It doesn\'t return anything so the type of the function itself is void.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">speak</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">food: string, energy: number</span>): <span class=\"hljs-title\">void</span> </span>{\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Our \"</span> + food + <span class=\"hljs-string\">\" has \"</span> + energy + <span class=\"hljs-string\">\" calories.\"</span>);\r\n}\r\n\r\nspeak(burger, calories);</pre>\r\n<p>Because TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript, and the latter has no idea what types are, they are completely removed:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// JavaScript code from the above TS example.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> burger = <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'hamburger\'</span>,\r\n    calories = <span class=\"hljs-number\">300</span>, \r\n    tasty = <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span>; \r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">speak</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">food, energy</span>) </span>{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Our \"</span> + food + <span class=\"hljs-string\">\" has \"</span> + energy + <span class=\"hljs-string\">\" calories.\"</span>);\r\n}\r\n\r\nspeak(burger, calories);</pre>\r\n<p>However, if we try to do something illegal, on compilation <code>tsc</code> will warn us that there is an error in our code. For example:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// The given type is boolean, the provided value is a string.</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> tasty: boolean = <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"I haven\'t tried it yet\"</span>;</pre>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs coffeescript\" data-type=\"plain\">main.ts(<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>,<span class=\"hljs-number\">5</span>): error TS2322: Type <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'string\'</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">is</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">not</span> assignable to type <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'boolean\'</span>.</pre>\r\n<p>It will also warn us if we pass the wrong argument to a function:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">speak</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">food: string, energy: number</span>): <span class=\"hljs-title\">void</span></span>{\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Our \"</span> + food + <span class=\"hljs-string\">\" has \"</span> + energy + <span class=\"hljs-string\">\" calories.\"</span>);\r\n}\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Arguments don\'t match the function parameters.</span>\r\nspeak(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"tripple cheesburger\"</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"a ton of\"</span>);</pre>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs coffeescript\" data-type=\"plain\">main.ts(<span class=\"hljs-number\">5</span>,<span class=\"hljs-number\">30</span>): error TS2345: Argument <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">of</span> type <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'string\'</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">is</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">not</span> assignable to parameter <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">of</span> type <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'number\'</span>.</pre>\r\n<p>Here are some of the most commonly used data types:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Number - All numeric values are represented by the number type, there aren\'t separate definitions for integers, floats or others.</li>\r\n<li>String - The text type, just like in vanilla JS strings can be surrounded by \'single quotes\' or \"double quotes\".</li>\r\n<li>Boolean - <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, using 0 and 1 will cause a compilation error.</li>\r\n<li>Any - A variable with this type can have it\'s value set to a string, number, or <strong><em>any</em></strong>thing else.</li>\r\n<li>Arrays - Has two possible syntaxes: <code>my_arr: number[];</code> or <code>my_arr: Array<number></code>.</li>\r\n<li>Void - Used on function that don\'t return anything.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To see a list of all of the available types, go to the official TypeScript docs - <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/07/5_interfaces.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Interfaces</h2>\r\n<p>Interfaces are used to type-check whether an object fits a certain structure. By defining an interface we can name a specific combination of variables, making sure that they will always go together. When translated to JavaScript, interfaces disappear - their only purpose is to help in the development stage.</p>\r\n<p>In the below example we define a simple interface to type-check a function\'s arguments:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Here we define our Food interface, its properties, and their types.</span>\r\ninterface Food {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">name</span>: string;\r\n    calories: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// We tell our function to expect an object that fulfills the Food interface. </span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// This way we know that the properties we need will always be available.</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">speak</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">food: Food</span>): <span class=\"hljs-title\">void</span></span>{\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Our \"</span> + food.name + <span class=\"hljs-string\">\" has \"</span> + food.calories + <span class=\"hljs-string\">\" calories.\"</span>);\r\n}\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// We define an object that has all of the properties the Food interface expects.</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Notice that types will be inferred automatically.</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> ice_cream = {\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">name</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"ice cream\"</span>, \r\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">calories</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">200</span>\r\n}\r\n\r\nspeak(ice_cream);</pre>\r\n<p>The order of the properties does NOT matter. We just need the required properties to be <strong>present</strong> and to be <strong>the right type</strong>. If something is missing, has the wrong type, or is named differently, the compiler will warn us.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\">interface Food {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">name</span>: string;\r\n    calories: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">speak</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">food: Food</span>): <span class=\"hljs-title\">void</span></span>{\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Our \"</span> + food.name + <span class=\"hljs-string\">\" has \"</span> + food.calories + <span class=\"hljs-string\">\" grams.\"</span>);\r\n}\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// We\'ve made a deliberate mistake and name is misspelled as nmae.</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> ice_cream = {\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">nmae</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"ice cream\"</span>, \r\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">calories</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">200</span>\r\n}\r\n\r\nspeak(ice_cream);</pre>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs bash\" data-type=\"plain\">main.ts(16,7): error TS2345: Argument of <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">type</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'{ nmae: string; calories: number; } \r\nis not assignable to parameter of type \'</span>Food<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'. \r\nProperty \'</span>name<span class=\"hljs-string\">\' is missing in type \'</span>{ nmae: string; calories: number; }<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'.</span></pre>\r\n<p>This is a beginners guide so we won\'t be going into more detail about interfaces. However, there is a lot more to them than what we\'ve mentioned here so we recommend you check out the TypeScript docs - <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/07/6_classes.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Classes</h2>\r\n<p>When building large scale apps, the object oriented style of programming is preferred by many developers, most notably in languages such as Java or C#. TypeScript offers a class system that is very similar to the one in these languages, including inheritance, abstract classes, interface implementations, setters/getters, and more.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s also fair to mention that since the most recent JavaScript update (ECMAScript 2015), classes are native to vanilla JS and can be used without TypeScript. The two implementation are very similar but have their differences, TypeScript being a bit more strict.</p>\r\n<p>Continuing with the food theme, here is a simple TypeScript class:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-class\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">Menu</span> </span>{\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Our properties:</span>\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// By default they are public, but can also be private or protected.</span>\r\n  items: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">Array</span><string>;  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// The items in the menu, an array of strings.</span>\r\n  pages: number;         <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// How many pages will the menu be, a number.</span>\r\n\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// A straightforward constructor. </span>\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">constructor</span>(item_list: Array<string>, total_pages: number) {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// The this keyword is mandatory.</span>\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">this</span>.items = item_list;    \r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">this</span>.pages = total_pages;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Methods</span>\r\n  list(): <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">void</span> {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Our menu for today:\"</span>);\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">for</span>(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> i=<span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>; i<<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">this</span>.items.length; i++) {\r\n      <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">this</span>.items[i]);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Create a new instance of the Menu class.</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> sundayMenu = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> Menu([<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"pancakes\"</span>,<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"waffles\"</span>,<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"orange juice\"</span>], <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>);\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Call the list method.</span>\r\nsundayMenu.list();</pre>\r\n<p>Anyone who has written at least a bit of Java or C# should find this syntax comfortably familiar. The same goes for inheritance:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-class\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">HappyMeal</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">Menu</span> </span>{\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Properties are inherited</span>\r\n\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// A new constructor has to be defined.</span>\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">constructor</span>(item_list: Array<string>, total_pages: number) {\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// In this case we want the exact same constructor as the parent class (Menu), </span>\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// To automatically copy it we can call super() - a reference to the parent\'s constructor.</span>\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">super</span>(item_list, total_pages);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Just like the properties, methods are inherited from the parent.</span>\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// However, we want to override the list() function so we redefine it.</span>\r\n  list(): <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">void</span>{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Our special menu for children:\"</span>);\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">for</span>(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> i=<span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>; i<<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">this</span>.items.length; i++) {\r\n      <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">this</span>.items[i]);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Create a new instance of the HappyMeal class.</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> menu_for_children = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> HappyMeal([<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"candy\"</span>,<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"drink\"</span>,<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"toy\"</span>], <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>);\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// This time the log message will begin with the special introduction.</span>\r\nmenu_for_children.list();</pre>\r\n<p>For a more in-depth look at classes in TS you can read the documentation - <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/07/7_generics.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Generics</h2>\r\n<p>Generics are templates that allow the same function to accept arguments of various different types. Creating reusable components using generics is better than using the <code>any</code> data type, as generics preserve the types of the variables that go in and out of them.</p>\r\n<p>A quick example would be a script that receives an argument and returns an array containing that same argument.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// The <T> after the function name symbolizes that it\'s a generic function.</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// When we call the function, every instance of T will be replaced with the actual provided type.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Receives one argument of type T,</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Returns an array of type T.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">genericFunc</span><<span class=\"hljs-title\">T</span>>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">argument: T</span>): <span class=\"hljs-title\">T</span>[] </span>{    \r\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> arrayOfT: T[] = [];    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Create empty array of type T.</span>\r\n  arrayOfT.push(argument);   <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Push, now arrayOfT = [argument].</span>\r\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> arrayOfT;\r\n}\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> arrayFromString = genericFunc<string>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"beep\"</span>);\r\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(arrayFromString[<span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>]);         <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// \"beep\"</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">typeof</span> arrayFromString[<span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>])   <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// String</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> arrayFromNumber = genericFunc(<span class=\"hljs-number\">42</span>);\r\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(arrayFromNumber[<span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>]);         <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// 42</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">typeof</span> arrayFromNumber[<span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>])   <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// number</span></pre>\r\n<p>The first time we called the function we manually set the type to string. This isn\'t required as the compiler can see what argument has been passed and automatically decide what type suits it best, like in the second call. Although it\'s not mandatory, providing the type every time is considered good practice as the compiler might fail to guess the right type in more complex scenarios.</p>\r\n<p>The TypeScript docs include a couple of advanced examples including generics classes, combining them with interfaces, and more. You can find them <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/07/8_modules.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Modules</h2>\r\n<p>Another important concept when working on large apps is modularity. Having your code split into many small reusable components helps your project stay organized and understandable, compared to having a single 10000-line file for everything.</p>\r\n<p>TypeScript introduces a syntax for exporting and importing modules, but cannot handle the actual wiring between files. To enable external modules TS relies on third-party libraries: <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">require.js</a> for browser apps and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CommonJS</a> for Node.js. Let\'s take a look at a simple example of TypeScript modules with require.js:</p>\r\n<p>We will have two files. One exports a function, the other imports and calls it.</p>\r\n<h3>exporter.ts</h3>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> sayHi = <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(): <span class=\"hljs-title\">void</span> </span>{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Hello!\"</span>);\r\n}\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> = sayHi;</pre>\r\n<h3>importer.ts</h3>\r\n<pre class=\"js hljs javascript\" data-type=\"js\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> sayHi = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'./exporter\'</span>);\r\nsayHi();</pre>\r\n<p>Now we need to download require.js and include it in a script tag - see how <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/docs/start.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>. The last step is to compile our two .ts files. An extra parameter needs to be added to tell TypeScript that we are building modules for require.js (also referred to as AMD), as opposed to CommonJS ones.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs nginx\" data-type=\"plain\"><span class=\"hljs-attribute\">tsc</span> --module amd <span class=\"hljs-regexp\">*.ts</span></pre>\r\n<p>Modules are quite complex and are out of the scope of this tutorial. If you want to continue reading about them head out to the TS docs - <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/07/9_declaration_files.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Third-party Declaration Files</h2>\r\n<p>When using a library that was originally designed for regular JavaScript, we need to apply a declaration file to make that library compatible with TypeScript. A declaration file has the extension <strong>.d.ts</strong> and contains various information about the library and its API.</p>\r\n<p>TypeScript declaration files are usually written by hand, but there\'s a high chance that the library you need already has a .d.ts. file created by somebody else. <a href=\"http://definitelytyped.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DefinitelyTyped</a> is the biggest public repository, containing files for over a thousand libraries. There is also a popular Node.js module for managing TypeScript definitions called <a href=\"https://github.com/typings/typings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Typings</a>.</p>\r\n<p>If you still need to write a declaration file yourself, this <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/writing-declaration-files.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">guide</a> will get you started.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2016/07/10_typescript_2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h2>pcoming Features in TypeScript 2.0</h2>\r\n<p>TypeScript is still under active development and is evlolving constantly. At the time of the writing of this tutorial the LTS version is 1.8.10, but Microsoft have already released a Beta for TypeScript 2.0. It\'s available for public testing and you can try it out now:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs coffeescript\" data-type=\"plain\"><span class=\"hljs-built_in\">npm</span> install -g typescript@beta</pre>\r\n<p>It introduces some handy new concepts such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Non-nullable types flag which prevents some variables from having their value set to <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.</li>\r\n<li>New improved system for getting declaration files directly with an <code>npm install</code>.</li>\r\n<li>Control flow type analysis that catches errors previously missed by the compiler.</li>\r\n<li>Some innovations in the module export/import syntax.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Another long-awaited feature is the ability to control the flow of asynchronous functions in an <code>async/await</code> block. This should be available in a future 2.1 update.</p>\r\n<h2>Further Reading</h2>\r\n<p>The amount of information in the official docs can be a bit overwhelming at first, but the benefits of going through it will be huge. Our tutorial is to be used as an introduction, so we haven\'t covered all of the chapters from the TypeScript documentation. Here are some of the more useful concepts that we\'ve skipped:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Namespaces - <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/namespaces.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Enums - <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Advanced Types and Type Guards - <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Writing JSX in TypeScript - <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>We hope you enjoyed this tutorial!</p>\r\n<p>Do you have any thoughts on TypeScript and would you consider using it in your projects?

Dispatch - Micro Framework</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/noodlehaus/dispatch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dispatch</a> is a minimal PHP framework. It doesn\'t give you the full MVC setup, but you can define URL rules and methods to better organize your application. This is perfect for APIs, simple sites or prototypes:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs php\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// include the library</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">include</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'dispatch.php\'</span>;\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// define your routes</span>\r\nget(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/greet\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span> </span>{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// render a view</span>\r\n    render(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'greet-form\'</span>);\r\n});\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// post handler</span>\r\npost(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/greet\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span> </span>{\r\n    $name = from($_POST, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'name\'</span>);\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// render a view while passing some locals</span>\r\n    render(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'greet-show\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">array</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'name\'</span> => $name));\r\n});\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// serve your site</span>\r\ndispatch();</pre>\r\n<p>You can match specific types of HTTP requests and paths, render views and more. If you combine Dispatch with some of the other frameworks here, you can have a really powerful and lightweight setup!</p>\r\n<h2>2. Klein – Lightning fast router for PHP</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/chriso/klein.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Klein</a> is another light weight routing library for PHP 5.3+. It has a bit more verbose syntax than Dispatch, but is quite fast. Here is an example:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs php\">respond(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/[:name]\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">($request)</span> </span>{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">echo</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'Hello \'</span> . $request->name;\r\n});</pre>\r\n<p>You can also subscribe to specific HTTP methods and use regexes as paths:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs php\">respond(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'GET\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/posts\'</span>, $callback);\r\nrespond(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'POST\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/posts/create\'</span>, $callback);\r\nrespond(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'PUT\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/posts/[i:id]\'</span>, $callback);\r\nrespond(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'DELETE\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/posts/[i:id]\'</span>, $callback);\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// To match multiple request methods:</span>\r\nrespond(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">array</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'POST\'</span>,<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'GET\'</span>), $route, $callback);\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Or you might want to handle the requests in the same place</span>\r\nrespond(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/posts/[create|edit:action]?/[i:id]?\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">($request, $response)</span> </span>{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">switch</span> ($request->action) {\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// do something</span>\r\n    }\r\n});</pre>\r\n<p>This is great for small projects, but you have to be disciplined when using a library like this for larger apps, as your code can become unmaintainable very fast. For this purpose, you would be better off with a full blown MVC framework like <a href=\"http://www.laravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Laravel</a> or <a href=\"http://www.codeigniter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CodeIgniter</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Ham - Routing Library with Caching</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/radiosilence/Ham\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ham</a> is also a lightweight routing framework but it utilizes caching for even more speed gains. It achieves this by caching anything I/O related in XCache/APC. Here is an example:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs php\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">require</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'../ham/ham.php\'</span>;\r\n\r\n$app = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> Ham(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'example\'</span>);\r\n$app->config_from_file(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'settings.php\'</span>);\r\n\r\n$app->route(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/pork\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">($app)</span> </span>{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Delicious pork.\"</span>;\r\n});\r\n\r\n$hello = <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">($app, $name=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'world\'</span>)</span> </span>{\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> $app->render(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'hello.html\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">array</span>(\r\n        <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'name\'</span> => $name\r\n    ));\r\n};\r\n$app->route(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/hello/<string>\'</span>, $hello);\r\n$app->route(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/\'</span>, $hello);\r\n\r\n$app->run();</pre>\r\n<p>The library requires that you have either XCache or APC installed, which would mean that it won\'t work on most hosting providers. But if you do have one of these installed or if you control your webserver, you should try this very fast framework.</p>\r\n<h2>4. Assetic - Asset Management</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Assetic</a> is am asset management framework for PHP. It combines and minifies your CSS/JS assets. Here is how it is used:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs php\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">use</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">Assetic</span>\\<span class=\"hljs-title\">Asset</span>\\<span class=\"hljs-title\">AssetCollection</span>;\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">use</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">Assetic</span>\\<span class=\"hljs-title\">Asset</span>\\<span class=\"hljs-title\">FileAsset</span>;\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">use</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">Assetic</span>\\<span class=\"hljs-title\">Asset</span>\\<span class=\"hljs-title\">GlobAsset</span>;\r\n\r\n$js = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> AssetCollection(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">array</span>(\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> GlobAsset(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/path/to/js/*\'</span>),\r\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> FileAsset(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/path/to/another.js\'</span>),\r\n));\r\n\r\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// the code is merged when the asset is dumped</span>\r\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">echo</span> $js->dump();</pre>\r\n<p>Combining assets in this manner is a good idea, as it can speed up your site. Not only is the total download size reduced, but also a lot of unnecessary HTTP requests are eliminated (two of the things that affect page load time the most).</p>\r\n<h2>5. ImageWorkshop - Image Manipulation with Layers</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://phpimageworkshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ImageWorkshop</a> is an Open Source library that lets you manipulate images with layers. With it you can resize, crop, make thumbnails, add watermarks and more.

Although it has been around since the 70s, it is still widely used, and you can\'t build a serious application without it. Most full-stack frameworks have libraries for dealing with the SQL complexity - <a href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ActiveRecord</a>, <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Doctrine</a>, <a href=\"http://hibernate.org/orm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hibernate</a> and more. But often times you need to get your hands dirty and write low-level SQL.</p>\r\n<p>This is why we\'ve prepared a short and to-the-point introduction to the basics of SQL. Within the article, you will find our interactive editors for writing and executing your code. Don\'t be afraid to experiment with them and try to complete the bonus tasks.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s begin!</p>\r\n<h2>1. Create Table</h2>\r\n<p>When creating new tables in SQL the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement is called. It expects as it\'s arguments all the columns we want in the table, as well as the their data types.</p>\r\n<p>Here we are creating a simple table called <strong>months</strong>. It consists of 3 columns:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>id - The number of the month in the calendar year (integer).</li>\r\n<li>name - Name of the month (string, maximum of 10 characters).</li>\r\n<li>days - The number of days in that month (integer).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>And this is how the respective SQL looks like:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">CREATE</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">TABLE</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">months</span> (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">id</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">int</span>, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">name</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">varchar</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">10</span>), <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">days</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">int</span>);</pre>\r\n<p>Also when creating tables, it\'s advisable to add a primary key to one of the columns. It will help keep entries unique and will speed up select queries. We won\'t be covering them in this lesson but you can read about them <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_primarykey.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Insert Rows</h2>\r\n<p>Now let\'s populate <strong>months</strong> with a few rows of information. Adding entries to a table is done via the <code>INSERT</code> statement. There are two different ways to use it:</p>\r\n<p>The first way does not specify the column names where the data will be inserted, it only expects the values and leaves it up to the developer to provide all the data in the correct order.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">INSERT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">INTO</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">months</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">VALUES</span> (<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>,<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'January\'</span>,<span class=\"hljs-number\">31</span>);</pre>\r\n<p>The above is shorter, but there is a major issue - if we add additional columns in the future, the query will break. The preferred way to write this is to include the columns:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">INSERT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">INTO</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">months</span> (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">id</span>,<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">name</span>,<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">days</span>) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">VALUES</span> (<span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>,<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'February\'</span>,<span class=\"hljs-number\">29</span>);</pre>\r\n<h2>3. Select</h2>\r\n<p>Select queries are our best friend when we want to fetch data from the database. They are used all the time so this lesson is going to spend a lot of time covering them.</p>\r\n<p>The most simple <code>SELECT</code> example would be this query, which will return all the columns and rows from the <strong>characters</strong> table:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span> * <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"characters\"</span></pre>\r\n<p>The asterisk (*) means that we want to grab all of the columns, without excluding anything. Since SQL databases usually consist of more then one table, the <code>FROM</code> keyword is required to specify which table we want to look in.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes we don\'t want all of the columns in a table. SQL allows us to choose and get only the ones we need: instead of putting the asterisk (*), we write the names of the desired columns.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">name</span>, weapon <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"characters\"</span></pre>\r\n<p>Also, in many cases we want the results be sorted in a certain way. In SQL we do this with <code>ORDER BY.</code> It can take an optional modifier - ASC (default) or DESC for sorting direction:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">name</span>, weapon <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"characters\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">ORDER</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">BY</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">name</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">DESC<br /></span></pre>\r\n<h2>4. Where</h2>\r\n<p>You learned how to select only specific columns, but what if only certain rows need to be acquired. To the rescue here comes the <code>WHERE</code> clause, allowing us to filter data depending on a condition.</p>\r\n<p>In this query we select only those entries from the <strong>characters</strong> table, who use a <strong>pistol</strong> to fight baddies.</p>\r\n<h2>5. AND / OR</h2>\r\n<p><code>WHERE</code> conditions can be made as specific as you like, with the help of the logical operators (<code>AND,OR</code>) and math-like comparisons (=,<,>,<=,>=,<>).</p>\r\n<p>Here we have a table containing the top 4 most sold albums of all time. Let\'s select those of them that are classified as <strong>rock</strong> and have sold <strong>under 50 million copies</strong>. This can easily be done by placing the <code>AND</code> operator between the two statements.</p>\r\n<h2>6. In/Between/Like</h2>\r\n<p>WHERE statements also support a few special commands, allowing a quick way to check commonly used queries. They are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>IN - compares the column to multiple possible values, resolves true if it matches at least one</li>\r\n<li>BETWEEN - checks if a value is within a range</li>\r\n<li>LIKE - searches for a specific pattern</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For example if we want to do a query selecting the <strong>pop</strong> and <strong>soul</strong> albums from our table, we can use <code>IN(\"value1\",\"value2\")</code>.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span> * <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span> albums <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">WHERE</span> genre <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">IN</span> (<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'pop\'</span>,<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'soul\'</span>);</pre>\r\n<p>If we want to get all the albums released <strong>between 1975 and 1985</strong> we would write:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span> * <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span> albums <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">WHERE</span> released <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">BETWEEN</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">1975</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">AND</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">1985</span>;</pre>\r\n<h2>7. Functions</h2>\r\n<p>SQL is packed with functions that do all sorts of helpful stuff. Here are some of the most regularly used ones:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>COUNT()</code> - returns the number of rows</li>\r\n<li><code>SUM()</code> - returns the total sum of a numeric column</li>\r\n<li><code>AVG()</code> - returns the average of a set of values</li>\r\n<li><code>MIN()</code> / <code>MAX()</code> - gets the minimum/maximum value from a column</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>8. Nested Select</h2>\r\n<p>In the previous point we learned how to do simple calculations with data. If we want to actually use the result from these calculations, often times a nested query (also known as <em>sub select</em>) is necessary. Let\'s say we want to get the <strong>artist</strong>, <strong>album</strong> and <strong>release year</strong> for the <strong>oldest</strong> album in the table.</p>\r\n<p>We know how to get these specific columns:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span> artist, album, released <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span> albums;</pre>\r\n<p>We also know how to get the earliest year:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">MIN</span>(released) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span> album;</pre>\r\n<p>All that is needed now is to combine the two with the help of WHERE:</p>\r\n<h2>9. Joining Tables</h2>\r\n<p>In more complex databases, most of the time there are several tables connected to each other in some way. For example, below in the editor are two tables about video games and video game developers.</p>\r\n<p>In the <strong>video_games</strong> table there is a <strong>developer</strong> column, but it holds an integer instead of the name of the developer. This number represents the <strong>id</strong> of the respective developer from the <strong>game_developers</strong> table, linking logically the two sheets, allowing us to use the information stored in both of them at the same time.</p>\r\n<p>If we want to create a query that returns everything we need to know about the games, we can use <code>INNER JOIN</code> to acquire the columns from both tables.</p>\r\n<h2>10. Aliases</h2>\r\n<p>If you look at the previous example you\'ll notice that there are two columns called <strong>name</strong>. That\'s confusing, so let\'s change it by setting an alias to one of the repeating columns: <strong>name</strong> from <strong>game_developers</strong> will appear as <strong>developer</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>We can also shorten the query drastically by setting aliases to the table names: <strong>video_games</strong> becomes <strong>games</strong> and <strong>game_developers</strong> becomes <strong>devs</strong>.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Update</h2>\r\n<p>Often times we have to change the data in some of the rows. In SQL this is done via the <code>UPDATE</code> statement.</p>\r\n<p>The usage of <code>UPDATE</code> consists of</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Choosing the table where the record we want to change is located.</li>\r\n<li>Setting new value(s) for the wanted column(s).</li>\r\n<li>Selecting with <code>WHERE</code> which of the rows we want to update. If this is omitted all rows in the table will change.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Here is a table of some of the highest rated TV series of all time. There is one tiny problem about it though, the show <em>Game of Thrones</em> is described as comedy, which it clearly isn\'t. Let\'s fix that!</p>\r\n<h2>12. Delete Rows</h2>\r\n<p>Deleting a table row through SQL is a really simple process. All that is needed is to select the right table and row we want to remove.</p>\r\n<h2>13. Deleting Tables</h2>\r\n<p>If we want to delete all the rows, but leave the table itself, the proper command is TRUNCATE:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">TRUNCATE</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">TABLE</span> table_name;</pre>\r\n<p>In the case when we actually want to remove every trace of the table whatsoever, the DROP command comes into play:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"hljs sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">DROP</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">TABLE</span> table_name;</pre>\r\n<p>Be very careful with these commands. There is no undo!</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>This wraps up our tutorial on SQL!

There are similar projects written in several languages including <a href=\"https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Java</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ochococo/Design-Patterns-In-Swift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Swift</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/tcorral/Design-Patterns-in-Javascript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JavaScript</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PHP</a>, so if you are coming from one of these programming background you can use them as a reference point.</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/kotlin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Learn X in Y minutes</a></h2>\r\n<p>A quick cheatsheet with some of the most important features and syntax quirks that will help you write better Kotlin code. There are examples on working with classes, loops, and lists, as well as implementations of classic programming problems such as generating a Fibonacci sequence.</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Kotlin Blog</a></h2>\r\n<p>The official blog for Kotlin by its authors at JetBrains. Here you can find all Kotlin related news and updates, as well as all kinds of tutorials, tips, and other useful articles.</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/kotlin/get-started.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Get Started with Kotlin on Android</a></h2>\r\n<p>A helpful article from the Google Developers blog that explains how to setup Android Studio for Kotlin, how to convert .java files to .kt files, and how to incorporate the new language into an existing Android project. There are also some code comparisons on the same Android APIs used with both Kotlin and Java.</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://fernandocejas.com/2017/02/03/android-testing-with-kotlin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Android Testing With Kotlin</a></h2>\r\n<p>Great article that shows us how to write and run tests for Android apps using Kotlin. The author does a great job of explaining what different types of tests are available, when to use them, and how to make sure we are testing properly. Another good tutorial on this topic can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/dbacinski/Android-Testing-With-Kotlin/blob/master/docs/Unit-Testing-Introduction.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>','2019-07-15 23:36:56','Kotlin is a modern programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine.
